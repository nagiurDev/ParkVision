## **Project Overview**

**ParkVision** is an intelligent parking analytics solution designed to monitor parking lots in real time using deep learning techniques. The project leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle detection and Supervision for tracking and analytics. This solution aims to extract detailed insights, such as parking occupancy and zone-specific metrics, from custom video data, providing a powerful tool for smart parking management.

### **Key Features/Insights & Metrics**

- Real-time vehicle detection in parking lots
- Parking zone configuration and occupancy tracking
- Quantitative metrics such as the number of cars in each zone
- Graphical representation of parking occupancy over time
- Efficient video processing for extracting frame-level details
